# Wine-quality-indicators
-------------------------

This repo contans the code for a machine learning model that will classify and predict wine quality based on 11 different factors. 
I used a random forest classifier to predict the quality of a wine with a 66.5% accuracy rate. I also performed some exploratory analysis to determine which factors will have the largest impact on quality.
